                <p>
                    I am an 18-year-old who thoroughly enjoys coding and anything involving computers. In my free time, I like to 
                    play video games and tinker with computer components.
                </p>
                <br><br>
                <p>
                    Coding has been something that was constantly on my mind. Through high school and the later years of middle school, 
                    I was greatly invested into Python and JavaScript to better myself in understanding.
                </p>
                <br><br>
                <p>
                    Nowadays, I have plans to eventually start developing video games with my free time and carry on with my other hobbies.

                <p>
                    I have become very familiarized with Python from my several high school classes I have taken.
                    While it has been some time since I have used Python last, it is a matter of muscle memory.

                <h2>JAVASCRIPT</h2>
                <p>
                    JavaScript is now second nature to me. I am incredibly well versed with what JavaScript is capable of
                    and can fluently code/understand it.

                <h2>HTML</h2>
                <p>
                    HTML is still coming to me. With each passing day I am becoming more familiar with it, however there is still 
                    much more potential out of me and my skills here.

                <h2>CSS</h2>
                <p>
                    CSS is the newest thing I have learned yet. I am still in the early learning stages, however I am picking up 
                    its capabilities rather quickly.
